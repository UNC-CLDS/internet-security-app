This is the android branch of Sad Cyber Sam, split directly from master. The rationale behind this is that the plugins used here are unchanged from the original app.

# Steps

1. Copy `www` from the `development` branch.

2. `$ cordova build`

3. Open `build.gradle` in Android Studio 2.3.3 and install the dependencies as prompted until you see BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
